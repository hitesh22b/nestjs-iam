There are several best practices and automation built into this project which will help you focus more on the actual development and writing code.\nDocumentation\n\nAnnotated code and component dependency diagrams\nTest Coverage\nAllure Report\n\nFeatures\n\nTypescript support\nOOP and DI (IOC) using the Nest Framework\nStrict linting support via TSLint\nTesting automation using Jest\nAuto generated documentation support using JsDoc format\nAuto generated changelog following Conventional Commit format\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNodeJs v10 or above\n\nInstallation\nSetup .npmrc to connect to private repo\nYou can create your own github access token by visiting this link and make sure your token has read:packages access.\nCreate a file named .npmrc and add the following details (replace your token) and make sure you add .npmrc to your .gitignore file.\n//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE\nregistry=https://registry.npmjs.org/\n@learnapp-co:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/Install the dependencies\n$ npm install @learnapp-co/backend-lib-boilerplateTemplate Usage\nYou can use this repo as a template and start your own backend library. There are few things that you need to take care of while:\n\nrename the project in package.json file\nproject name must start with @learnapp-co/\nif you have admin privilege then add the github token as secret, else contact admin for support\nrun npm publish --dry-run locally to test everything is packaged up as expected\n\nBuild\nTo build the library you can use the following command:\n$ npm run start:dev\n# or\n$ npm run buildTest\n# unit tests\n$ npm run test\n\n# do TDD by watching test files and running unit test on file change\n$ npm run test:watch\n\n# e2e tests\n$ npm run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ npm run test:covDocumentation\nYou can generate component and annotated source documentation as follows:\n$ npm run docsLinting\nThere is an extensive support for linting via ESLint which enforces strict rules. The following commands can be used to help lint or fix minor linting issues:\n# Format the code\n$ npm run format\n\n# Auto fix linting issues\n$ npm run lint:fixGit Comment Format\nAll commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commit standards and the boilerplate application enforces this and wrong commit formats will fail and will be rejected by the system.\nRelease\nOnce a feature is ready for deployment to the Staging environment (which a replica of production), the developer must log the changes in the CHANGELOG and increment the application version in the package.json file.\nThis process has been automated can be done by running the command:\nnpm run releaseTo forgo the automated version bump use --release-as with the argument major, minor or patch.\nSuppose the last version of your code is 1.0.0, you've only landed fix: commits, but you would like your next release to be a minor.\nSimply run the following:\nnpm run release -- --release-as minor\n# Or\nnpm run release -- --release-as 1.1.0If you would like to see what commands would be run, without committing to git or updating files:\nnpm run release -- --dry-run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) [2019][LearnApp]\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
